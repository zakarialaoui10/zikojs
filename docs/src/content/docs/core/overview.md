**`ziko`** is the foundational layer of the Zikojs ecosystem.
Designed with no external dependencies, it provides the essential core modules :
- Math 
- UI 
- Time
- Router 
- Hooks

ziko’s architecture is composable, allowing you to use the full API or only the modules you need.
For example, you can leverage just the Math module to build custom functionality — the approach that powers Numz, Zikojs’ numerical computing library.
